# SwiftExtensions
> One of the best features of Swift, from my point of view, is extensions. They enable you to add new methods to any class and the whole project will be able to call them without additional inheritance and overloading.
Plus with several new methods (extensions) weâ€™ll get a short, clean and easily maintainable code in Swift.
